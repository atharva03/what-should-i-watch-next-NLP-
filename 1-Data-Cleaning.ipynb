us,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Here\\'s the thing, if you cannot\\nmeasure it, it does not exist.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd I thought he was just\\nsweet-talking

understand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat I have a bachelor\\'s\\nand a master\\'s in social work,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,\\nso my entire academic career\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas surrounded by people who kind of\\nbelieved in the \"life\\'s messy, love it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd I\\'m more of the, \"life\\'s messy,\\nclean it up, organize it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand put it into a bento box.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t

—\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treally, one of the big sayings\\nin social work is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd I\\'m like, knock discomfort\\nupside the head\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand move it over and get all A\\'s.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat was my mantra.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo I was very excited about this.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd so I thought, you know what,\\nthis is the career for me,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause I am interested\\nin some messy topics.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut I want to be able\\nto make them not messy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI want to understand them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI want to hack into these things\\nthat I know are important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand lay the code out for everyone to see.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo where I started was with connection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause, by the time\\nyou\\'re a social worker for 10 years,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhat you realize is that connection\\nis why we\\'re here.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt\\'s what gives purpose\\nand meaning to our lives.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is what it\\'s all about.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt doesn\\'t matter whether\\nyou talk to people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twho work in social justice,\\nmental health and abuse and neglect,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhat we know is that connection,\\nthe ability to feel connected, is —\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tneurobiologically\\nthat\\'s how we\\'re wired —\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tit\\'s why we\\'re here.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo I thought, you know what,\\nI\\'m going to start with connection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWell, you know that situation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhere you get an evaluation\\nfrom your boss,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand she tells you 37 things\\nthat you do really awesome,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand one \"opportunity for growth?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Laughter)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd all you can think about\\nis that opportunity for growth, right?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWell, apparently this is the way\\nmy work went as well,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause, when you ask people about love,\\nthey tell you about heartbreak.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen you ask people about belonging,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey\\'ll tell you their most excruciating\\nexperiences of being excluded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd when you ask people about connection,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe stories they told me\\nwere about disconnection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo very quickly — really about six weeks\\ninto this research —\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI ran into this unnamed thing\\nthat absolutely unraveled connection\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin a way that I didn\\'t understand\\nor had never seen.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd so I pulled back out of the research\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand thought, I need\\nto figure out what this is.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd it turned out to be shame.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd shame is really easily understood\\nas the fear of disconnection:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIs there something about me that,\\nif other people know it or see it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat I won\\'t be worthy of connection?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe things I can tell you about it:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt\\'s universal; we all have it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe only people who don\\'t experience shame\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thave no capacity for human\\nempathy or connection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNo one wants to talk about it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand the less you talk about it,\\nthe more you have it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat underpinned this shame,\\nthis \"I\\'m not good enough,\" —\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich, we all know that feeling:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I\\'m not blank enough.\\nI\\'m not thin enough,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trich enough, beautiful enough,\\nsmart enough, promoted enough.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe thing that underpinned this\\nwas excruciating vulnerability.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis idea of, in order\\nfor connection to
