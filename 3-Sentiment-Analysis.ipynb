       "[[' \"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, and Mourners to and fro kept treading — treading — till [it seemed] that Sense was breaking through — And when they all were seated, a Service, like a Drum — kept beating — beating — till I [thought] my Mind was going numb — And then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul with those same Boots of Lead, again, then Space — began to toll, As [all] the Heavens were a Bell, and Being, [but] an Ear, and I, and Silence, some strange Race, wrecked, solitary, here — [And] then a Plank in Reason, broke, and I fell down and down — and hit a World, at every plunge, and Finished knowing — then —\"   We know depression through metaphors. Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language, Goya in an image. Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states.   As for me, I had always thought myself tough, one of the people who could survive if I\\'d been sent to a concentration camp.   In 1991, I had a series of losses. My mother died, a relationship I\\'d been in ended, I moved back to the United States from some years abroad, and I got through all of those experiences intact.   But in 1994, three years later, I found myself losing interest in almost everything. I didn\\'t want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do, and I didn\\'t know why. The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine, and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends, I would think, \"What a lot of people that is to have to call back.\" Or I would decide I should have lunch, and then I would think, but I\\'d have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it, and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.   And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it\\'s ridiculous. You know it\\'s ridiculous while you\\'re experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it\\'s not a big deal, and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity.   And then the anxiety set in. If you told me that I\\'d have to be depressed for the next month, I would say, \"As long I know it\\'ll be over in November, I can do it.\" But if you said to me, \"You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,',\n",
       "  '\" I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you\\'re walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you, but instead of lasting half a second, the way that does, it lasted for six months. It\\'s a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you\\'re afraid of. And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people.   And finally one day, I woke up and I thought perhaps I\\'d had a stroke, because I lay in bed completely frozen, looking at the telephone, thinking, \"Something is wrong and I should call for help,\" and I couldn\\'t reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it, the phone rang, and somehow I managed to pick it up, and it was my father, and I said, \"I\\'m in serious trouble. We need to do something.\"   The next day I started with the medications and the therapy. And I also started reckoning with this terrible question: If I\\'m not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp, then who am I? And if I have to take medication, is that medication making me more fully myself, or is it making me someone else? And how do I feel about it if it\\'s making me someone else?   I had two advantages as I went into the fight. The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking, I had a nice life, and that if I could only get well, there was something at the other end that was worth living for. And the other was that I had access to good treatment.   But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. And I thought, \"But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem? And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?\" And I couldn\\'t figure out which it was. And then I understood that actually, we aren\\'t advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully. The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play, and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality.   I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling. They\\'re not very effective. They\\'re extremely costly. They come with innumerable side effects. They\\'re a disaster. But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago, when there would have been almost nothing to be done. I hope that 50 y',\n",
       "  'ears hence, people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science.   Depression is the flaw in love. If you were married to someone and thought, \"Well, if my wife dies, I\\'ll find another one,\" it wouldn\\'t be love as we know it. There\\'s no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss, and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy.   There are three things people tend to confuse: depression, grief and sadness. Grief is explicitly reactive. If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy, and then, six months later, you are still deeply sad, but you\\'re functioning a little better, it\\'s probably grief, and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. If you experience a catastrophic loss, and you feel terrible, and six months later you can barely function at all, then it\\'s probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. The trajectory tells us a great deal. People think of depression as being just sadness. It\\'s much, much too much sadness, much too much grief at far too slight a cause.   As I set out to understand depression, and to interview people who had experienced it, I found that there were people who seemed, on the surface, to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it. And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes. And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people. What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive? And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression.   One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead, and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness, that this is a serious business. It\\'s the leading disability worldwide, and people die of it every day.   One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years, and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college, and then plummeted into a horrific depression. She had bipolar illness, or manic depression, as it was then known. And then she did very well for many years on lithium, and then eventually, she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it, and she had another psychosis, and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat i',\n",
       "  'n her parents\\' apartment, more or less catatonic, essentially without moving, day after day after day. And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later — she\\'s a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins — when I interviewed her, she said, \"I was singing \\'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,\\' over and over, to occupy my mind. I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying, which were, \\'You are nothing. You are nobody. You don\\'t even deserve to live.\\' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself.\"   You don\\'t think in depression that you\\'ve put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you\\'re seeing truly. It\\'s easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there\\'s something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it\\'s difficult with depressives, because we believe we are seeing the truth.   But the truth lies. I became obsessed with that sentence: \"But the truth lies.\" And I discovered, as I talked to depressive people, that they have many delusional perceptions. People will say, \"No one loves me.\" And you say, \"I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you.\" You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people. But people who are depressed will also say, \"No matter what we do, we\\'re all just going to die in the end.\" Or they\\'ll say, \"There can be no true communion between two human beings. Each of us is trapped in his own body.\" To which you have to say, \"That\\'s true, but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast.\"   (Laughter)   A lot of the time, what they are expressing is not illness, but insight, and one comes to think what\\'s really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don\\'t distract us very much. There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour, and at the end of the hour, they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed. The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent, and the non-depressed people guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters —   (Laughter)   as they had actually killed.   A lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression, that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet, to have people know. They said, \"Do people talk to you differently?\" I said, \"Yes, people talk to me differently. They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience, or thei',\n",
       "  'r sister\\'s experience, or their friend\\'s experience. Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has.   I went a few years ago to a conference, and on Friday of the three-day conference, one of the participants took me aside, and she said, \"I suffer from depression and I\\'m a little embarrassed about it, but I\\'ve been taking this medication, and I just wanted to ask you what you think?\" And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could. And then she said, \"You know, my husband would never understand this. He\\'s really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn\\'t make any sense, so, you know, it\\'s just between us.\" And I said, \"Yes, that\\'s fine.\" On Sunday of the same conference, her husband took me aside,   (Laughter)   and he said, \"My wife wouldn\\'t think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this, but I\\'ve been dealing with this depression and I\\'m taking some medication, and I wondered what you think?\" They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom.   (Laughter)   And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems.   (Laughter)   But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. Depression is so exhausting. It takes up so much of your time and energy, and silence about it, it really does make the depression worse.   And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better. I\\'d started off as a medical conservative. I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked, it was clear what they were — there was medication, there were certain psychotherapies, there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment, and that everything else was nonsense. But then I discovered something. If you have brain cancer, and you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer, and you\\'ll still probably die from it. But if you say that you have depression, and standing on your head for 20 minutes every day makes you feel better, then it\\'s worked, because depression is an illness of how you feel, and if you feel better, then you are effectively not depressed anymore. So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments.   And I get letters, I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what\\'s worked for them. Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation. My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy, medication, she had tried pretty much everything, and she h',\n",
       "  'ad found a solution and hoped I would tell the world, and that was making little things from yarn.   (Laughter)   She sent me some of them.   (Laughter)   And I\\'m not wearing them right now.   (Laughter)   I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.   And yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments, I also gained perspective on other treatments. I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram\\'s blood and that I\\'m not going to detail right now, but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda, working on a different project, and I happened to describe my experience to someone, and he said, \"Well, that\\'s West Africa, and we\\'re in East Africa, and our rituals are in some ways very different, but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you\\'re describing.\" And he said, \"But we\\'ve had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers, especially the ones who came right after the genocide.\" I said, \"What kind of trouble did you have?\" And he said, \"Well, they would do this bizarre thing. They didn\\'t take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better. They didn\\'t include drumming or music to get people\\'s blood going. They didn\\'t involve the whole community. They didn\\'t externalize the depression as an invasive spirit. Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them.\"   (Laughter)   (Applause)   He said, \"We had to ask them to leave the country.\"   (Laughter)   Now at the other end of alternative treatments, let me tell you about Frank Russakoff. Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I\\'ve ever seen in a man. He was constantly depressed. He was, when I met him, at a point at which every month, he would have electroshock treatment. Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week. Then he would feel okay for a week. Then he would have a week of going downhill. And then he would have another electroshock treatment. And he said to me when I met him, \"It\\'s unbearable to go through my weeks this way. I can\\'t go on this way, and I\\'ve figured out how I\\'m going to end it if I don\\'t get better.\" \"But,\" he said to me, \"I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery, and I think I\\'m going to give that a try.\" And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism to reach out for one more. And he had the cingulotomy, and i',\n",
       "  't was incredibly successful.   He\\'s now a friend of mine. He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children. He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery, and he said, \"My father sent me two presents this year, First, a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didn\\'t really need, but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I\\'m living on my own and have a job I seem to love. And the other present was a photo of my grandmother, who committed suicide. As I unwrapped it, I began to cry, and my mother came over and said, \\'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?\\' And I said, \\'She had the same disease I have.\\' I\\'m crying now as I write to you. It\\'s not that I\\'m so sad, but I get overwhelmed, I think, because I could have killed myself, but my parents kept me going, and so did the doctors, and I had the surgery. I\\'m alive and grateful. We live in the right time, even if it doesn\\'t always feel like it.\"   I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing, and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts, and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent. And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression. And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression. Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability, which is presumably evenly distributed in the population, and triggering circumstances, which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished. And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time, you think, \"Why do I feel like this? I must have depression.\" And you set out to find treatment for it. But if you have a perfectly awful life, and you feel miserable all the time, the way you feel is commensurate with your life, and it doesn\\'t occur to you to think, \"Maybe this is treatable.\"   And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that\\'s not being picked up and that\\'s not being treated and that\\'s not being addressed, and it\\'s a tragedy of a grand order. And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C., where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression, and then provided six months of the experimental protocol. One of them, Lolly, came in, and this is what she said the day she came in. She said, and she was a woman, by the way, who had seven children. She said, \"I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn\\'t go out ',\n",
       "  'of the house. I have nothing to say to my children. In the morning, I can\\'t wait for them to leave, and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head, and three o\\'clock when they come home, it just comes so fast.\" She said, \"I\\'ve been taking a lot of Tylenol, anything I can take so that I can sleep more. My husband has been telling me I\\'m stupid, I\\'m ugly. I wish I could stop the pain.\"   Well, she was brought into this experimental protocol, and when I interviewed her six months later, she had taken a job working in childcare for the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband, and she said to me, \"My kids are so much happier now.\" She said, \"There\\'s one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls, but at night, they\\'re just all up on my bed, and we\\'re doing homework all together and everything. One of them wants to be a preacher, one of them wants to be a firefighter, and one of the girls says she\\'s going to be a lawyer. They don\\'t cry like they used to, and they don\\'t fight like they did. That\\'s all I need now, is my kids. Things keep on changing, the way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act. I can go outside not being afraid anymore, and I don\\'t think those bad feelings are coming back, and if it weren\\'t for Dr. Miranda and that, I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head, if I were still alive at all. I asked the Lord to send me an angel, and He heard my prayers.\"   I was really moved by these experiences, and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on, but also in an article, and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent.   And I turned in my story, and my editor called me and said, \"We really can\\'t publish this.\"   And I said, \"Why not?\"   And she said, \"It just is too far-fetched. These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they\\'re virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley? It\\'s just too implausible.\" She said, \"I\\'ve never even heard of anything like it.\"   And I said, \"The fact that you\\'ve never heard of it is an indication that it is news.\"   (Laughter)   (Applause)   \"And you are a news magazine.\"   So after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it. But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment, the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities, that would be exploitative, because we would be changing them. There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us, tha',\n",
       "  't treatment of depression, the medications and so on, are an artifice, and that it\\'s not natural. And I think that\\'s very misguided. It would be natural for people\\'s teeth to fall out, but there is nobody militating against toothpaste, at least not in my circles.   People then say, \"But isn\\'t depression part of what people are supposed to experience? Didn\\'t we evolve to have depression? Isn\\'t it part of your personality?\" To which I would say, mood is adaptive. Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have, that\\'s incredibly valuable. And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken. It\\'s maladaptive.   People will come to me and say, \"I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year, I think I can just get through this.\"   And I always say to them, \"You may get through it, but you\\'ll never be 37 again. Life is short, and that\\'s a whole year you\\'re talking about giving up. Think it through.\"   It\\'s a strange poverty of the English language, and indeed of many other languages, that we use this same word, depression, to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday, and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide.   People say to me, \"Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?\" And I say, in a way it\\'s continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity, but it\\'s the same way there\\'s continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting, and what happens if you leave the house for 100 years and it rusts through until it\\'s only a pile of orange dust. And it\\'s that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that\\'s the one we\\'re setting out to address.   So now people say, \"You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?\" And I don\\'t. But I don\\'t feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don\\'t feel sad about my answering machine, and I don\\'t feel sad about taking a shower. I feel more, in fact, I think, because I can feel sadness without nullity. I feel sad about professional disappointments, about damaged relationships, about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion? How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through? What is the mechanism of resilience?   And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience, and say, \"I was depressed a long time ago, I never want to think about it again, I\\'m not going to look at it and I\\'m just going to get on with my life,\" ',\n",
       "  'ironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it, it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience.   So Frank Russakoff said to me, \"If I had a do-over, I suppose I wouldn\\'t do it this way, but in a strange way, I\\'m grateful for what I\\'ve experienced. I\\'m glad to have been in the hospital 40 times. It taught me so much about love, and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me, and will be always.\"   And Maggie Robbins said, \"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic, and I would just talk and talk and talk, and the people I was dealing with weren\\'t very responsive, and I thought, \\'That\\'s not very friendly or helpful of them.\\'\"   (Laughter)   \"And then I realized, I realized that they weren\\'t going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk. It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn\\'t have AIDS and I wasn\\'t dying, but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were. Our needs are our greatest assets. It turns out I\\'ve learned to give all the things I need.\"   Valuing one\\'s depression does not prevent a relapse, but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate. The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful. It\\'s of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again, \"This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it.\" I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts, and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and these days, my life is vital, even on the days when I\\'m sad. I felt that funeral in my brain, and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world, and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.   I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I\\'ve found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely, and sometimes against the moment\\'s reason, to cleave to the reasons for living. And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.   Thank you.   (Applause)   Thank you.   (Appla'],\n",
       " [' So, I\\'ll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called, and she said, \"I\\'m really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.\" And I thought, \"Well, what\\'s the struggle?\" And she said, \"Well, I saw you speak, and I\\'m going to call you a researcher, I think, but I\\'m afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they\\'ll think you\\'re boring and irrelevant.\"   (Laughter)   And I was like, \"Okay.\" And she said, \"But the thing I liked about your talk is you\\'re a storyteller. So I think what I\\'ll do is just call you a storyteller.\" And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, \"You\\'re going to call me a what?\" And she said, \"I\\'m going to call you a storyteller.\" And I was like, \"Why not \\'magic pixie\\'?\"   (Laughter)   I was like, \"Let me think about this for a second.\" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. I\\'m a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that\\'s what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I\\'m just a storyteller. And so I said, \"You know what? Why don\\'t you just say I\\'m a researcher-storyteller.\" And she went, \"Ha ha. There\\'s no such thing.\"   (Laughter)   So I\\'m a researcher-storyteller, and I\\'m going to talk to you today — we\\'re talking about expanding perception — and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.   And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research prof',\n",
       "  'essor who said to us, \"Here\\'s the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist.\" And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. I was like, \"Really?\" and he was like, \"Absolutely.\" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor\\'s and a master\\'s in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the \"life\\'s messy, love it.\" And I\\'m more of the, \"life\\'s messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box.\"   (Laughter)   And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me — really, one of the big sayings in social work is, \"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\" And I\\'m like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A\\'s. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see.   So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time you\\'re a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we\\'re here. It\\'s what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it\\'s all about. It doesn\\'t matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is — neurobiologically that\\'s how we\\'re wired — it\\'s why we\\'re here.   So I thought, you know what, I\\'m going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evalu',\n",
       "  'ation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one \"opportunity for growth?\"   (Laughter)   And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they\\'ll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection.   So very quickly — really about six weeks into this research — I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn\\'t understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won\\'t be worthy of connection?   The things I can tell you about it: It\\'s universal; we all have it. The only people who don\\'t experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this \"I\\'m not good enough,\" — which, we all know that feeling: \"I\\'m not blank enough. I\\'m not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough.\" The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.   And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, ',\n",
       "  \"this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know, it's not going to turn out well.   (Laughter)   You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to — and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research.   My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories — thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay — and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness — that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness — they have a strong sense of love and belonging — and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.   There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keep\",\n",
       "  's us out of connection is our fear that we\\'re not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those.   What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction, but that\\'s another talk. So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? And the first words that came to my mind were \"whole-hearted.\" These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. What\\'s the theme? What\\'s the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I\\'m just writing and in my researcher mode.   And so here\\'s what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language — it\\'s from the Latin word \"cor,\" meaning \"heart\" — and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can\\'t practice compassion with other people if we can\\'t treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had con',\n",
       "  'nection, and — this was the hard part — as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.   The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn\\'t talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating — as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, \"I love you\" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They\\'re willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental.   I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job — you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown —   (Laughter)   — which actually looked more like this.   (Laughter)   And it did.   I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.   (Laughter)   A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you ca',\n",
       "  'll your friends and say, \"I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?\" Because about five of my friends were like, \"Wooo, I wouldn\\'t want to be your therapist.\"   (Laughter)   I was like, \"What does that mean?\" And they\\'re like, \"I\\'m just saying, you know. Don\\'t bring your measuring stick.\"   (Laughter)   I was like, \"Okay.\" So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana — I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, \"How are you?\" And I said, \"I\\'m great. I\\'m okay.\" She said, \"What\\'s going on?\" And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.   (Laughter)   And so I said, \"Here\\'s the thing, I\\'m struggling.\" And she said, \"What\\'s the struggle?\" And I said, \"Well, I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it\\'s also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem, and I need some help.\" And I said, \"But here\\'s the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit.\"   (Laughter)   \"I just need some strategies.\"   (Laughter)   (Applause)   Thank you. So she goes like this.   (Laughter)   And then I said, \"It\\'s bad, right?\" And she said, \"It\\'s neither good nor bad.\"   (Laughter)   \"It just is what it is.\" And I said, \"Oh my God, this is going to suck.\"   (Laughter)   And it did, and it didn\\'t. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that\\'s not me, and B: I don\\'t even hang out with p',\n",
       "  'eople like that.   (Laughter)   For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back.   And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No.   So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability — when we\\'re waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, \"How would you define vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?\" And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what\\'s out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I\\'m sick, and we\\'re newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.   And I think there\\'s evidence — and it\\'s not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it\\'s a huge cause — We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is — and I learned this from the research — that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can\\'t say, here\\'s the bad stuff. Here\\'s vulnerability, here\\'s grief, here\\'s shame, here\\'s fear, here\\'s disappointment. I don\\'t want to feel these. I\\'m going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.   (Laughter)   ',\n",
       "  'I don\\'t want to feel these. And I know that\\'s knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God.   (Laughter)   You can\\'t numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle.   One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn\\'t just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that\\'s uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. \"I\\'m right, you\\'re wrong. Shut up.\" That\\'s it. Just certain. The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There\\'s no discourse anymore. There\\'s no conversation. There\\'s just blame. You know how blame is described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there\\'s anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn\\'t work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.   (Laughter)   Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, \"Wow.\"   (Laughter)   And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They\\'re hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, \"Look at her, she\\'s perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect — make sure she makes t',\n",
       "  'he tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.\" That\\'s not our job. Our job is to look and say, \"You know what? You\\'re imperfect, and you\\'re wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.\" That\\'s our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we\\'ll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn\\'t have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate — whether it\\'s a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we\\'re doing doesn\\'t have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... \"We\\'re sorry. We\\'ll fix it.\"   But there\\'s another way, and I\\'ll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there\\'s no guarantee — and that\\'s really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that\\'s excruciatingly difficult — to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we\\'re wondering, \"Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?\" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, \"I\\'m just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I\\'m alive.\" And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we\\'re enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, \"I\\'m enough\" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we\\'re kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we\\'re kinder and gentler to ourselves.   That\\'s all I have. Thank you.   (Applaus'],\n",

And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress.   (Laughter)   So luckily, I brought an outfit change. This is the first outfit change on the TED stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think. If some of the women were really horrified when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.   (Laughter)   I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds. Not everybody gets to do that. These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. The worst part is putting this sweater over my head, because that's when you'll all laugh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my head. All right.  \",\n",
       "  \" So, why did I do that? That was awkward.   (Laughter)   Well —   (Laughter)   Hopefully not as awkward as that picture. Image is powerful, but also, image is superficial.

I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. And of course, barring surgery, or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look, and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives.

I'm going to answer the questions that\",\n",
       "  ' people always ask me, but with an honest twist.   So the first question is, how do you become a model? I always just say, \"Oh, I was scouted,\" but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy, and maybe you\\'re wondering what is a legacy. Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we\\'re biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it\\'s a legacy that I\\'ve been cashing out on. And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like, \"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen.\" And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.   (Laughter)   But unfortunately, I have to i',\n",
       "  'nform you that in 2007, a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired, and of the 677 models that were hired, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.   The next question people always ask is, \"Can I be a model when I grow up?\" And the first answer is, \"I don\\'t know, they don\\'t put me in charge of that.\" But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, \"Why? You know? You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome, because you\\'d be the first one.\"   (Laughter)   If, after this amazing list, they still are like, \"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,\" well, then I say, \"Be my boss.\" Because I\\'m not in charge of anything, and you could be the editor in chief of America',\n",
       "  'n Vogue or the CEO of H&M, or the next Steven Meisel. Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. It\\'s out of your control, and it\\'s awesome, and it\\'s not a career path.   I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge, because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons, it can just be distilled right now. So, if the photographer is right there, the light is right there, like a nice HMI, and the client says, \"We want a walking shot,\" this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth, just do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends, 300, 400, 500 times.

They are constructions, and they are constructions by a group of professionals, by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production, and they build this. That\\'s not me.   Okay, so the next question people always ask me is, \"Do you get free stuff?\"   (Laughter)   I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear, except for earlier, but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that\\'s what we don\\'t like to talk about.   I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free. When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course, we got pulled ',\n",
       "  'over, and all it took was a \"Sorry, officer,\" and we were on our way. And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are.   I live in New York, and last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked, 86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men. And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it\\'s not a question of, \"Will I get stopped?\" but \"How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?\" When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States, 53% don\\'t like their bodies, and that number goes to 78% by the time that they\\'re 17.   So, the last question people ask me is, \"What is it like to be a model?\" And I think the answer that they\\'re looking for is, \"If you are a little bit ',\n",
       "  'skinnier and you have shinier hair, you will be so happy and fabulous.\" And when we\\'re backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. We say, \"It\\'s really amazing to travel, and it\\'s amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people.\" And those things are true, but they\\'re only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is, \"I am insecure.\" And I\\'m insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering, \"If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?\" you just need to meet a group of models, because they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes, and they\\'re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.   When I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on',\n",
       "  ' the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, \"Look I\\'ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,\" and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, \"and it doesn\\'t always make me happy.\" But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.   But I\\'m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it\\'s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I\\'d had more agency in my career, because maybe then I wouldn\\'t tell the story of how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn\\'t tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now.   If there\\'s a takeaway to this talk, I hope it\\'s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures.   Thank you.   (Applau'],\n",
       " [' All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food?   (Laughter)   And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don\\'t want to talk to them?   (Laughter)   You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in \"My Fair Lady\": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects —   (Laughter)   are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can\\'t speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it\\'s not normal. Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We\\'re less likely to compromise, which means we\\'re not listening to',\n",
       "  ' each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means we\\'re not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.   Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. There\\'s this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: \"I came to realize...\"   (Laughter)   \"I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engagin',\n",
       "  'g with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?\"   Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don\\'t like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I\\'d like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.   Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you\\'re paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap.   (Laughter)   There is no reason to learn how to show you\\'re paying attention if ',\n",
       "  \"you are in fact paying attention.   (Laughter)   (Applause)   Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody.   We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before. We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.   So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations.   Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your a\",\n",
       "  \"rgument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.   Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog.   (Laughter)   Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listen\",\n",
       "  'er. Again, assume that you have something to learn.   Bill Nye: \"Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don\\'t.\" I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.   Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question, you\\'re going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, \"Were you terrified?\" you\\'re going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is \"terrified,\" and the answer is \"Yes, I was\" or \"No, I wasn\\'t.\" \"Were you angry?\" \"Yes, I was very angry.\" Let them describe it. They\\'re the ones that know. Try asking them things like, \"What was that like?\" \"How did that feel?\" Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you\\'re going to get a much more interesting response.   Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. We\\'ve heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks',\n",
       "  \" a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.   (Laughter)   And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go.   Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap.   Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about \",\n",
       "  'how much you hate your job. It\\'s not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly, it is not about you. You don\\'t need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you\\'ve suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, \"I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers.\"   (Laughter)   Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.   Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It\\'s condescending, and it\\'s really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. Don\\'t do that.   Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don\\'t care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you\\'re struggling to come up with in your mind. They don\\'t care. What they care about is you. They care about what you\\'re like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out.   Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell yo',\n",
       "  'u how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I\\'m paraphrasing, \"If your mouth is open, you\\'re not learning.\" And Calvin Coolidge said, \"No man ever listened his way out of a job.\"   (Laughter)   Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we\\'d rather talk. When I\\'m talking, I\\'m in control. I don\\'t have to hear anything I\\'m not interested in. I\\'m the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there\\'s another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can\\'t do that, you\\'re not in a conversation. You\\'re just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.   (Laughter)   You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, \"Most of us don\\'t listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the in',\n",
       "  'tent to reply.\"   One more rule, number 10, and it\\'s this one: Be brief.   [A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. — My Sister]   (Laughter)   (Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people.   You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she\\'d say, \"Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He\\'s a Russian ballet dancer.\" And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think it\\'s what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I\\'m always prepared to be amazed, and I\\'m never disappointed.   You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.   Thanks.   (Applaus'],\n",

Maybe like an evil laugh: \"Wuhahaha.\"   (Laughter)   \"I will kill you in the name of Allah, wuhahahahaha.\"   (Laughter)   But never like, \"Ha ha ha ha la.\"   (Laughter)   We like to laugh. We like to celebrate life. And I wish more Americans would travel here. I always encourage my friends: \"Travel, see ',\n",
       "  'the Middle East, there\\'s so much to see, so many good people.\" And it\\'s vice versa, and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening.   For example, I don\\'t know if you heard about this, a little while ago in the US, there was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane, talking about the safest place to sit on the plane. Some passengers overheard them, somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk, got them kicked off the plane. It was a family, a mother, father, child, talking about the seating. As a Middle Eastern male, I know there\\'s certain things I\\'m not supposed to say on an airplane in the US, right? I\\'m not supposed to be walk',\n",
       "  'ing down the aisle, and be like, \"Hi, Jack.\" That\\'s not cool.   (Laughter)   Even if I\\'m there with my friend named Jack, I say, \"Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack.\" Never \"Hi, Jack.\"   (Laughter)   But now, apparently we can\\'t even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane.   So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim, so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos, everyone, if you\\'re brown —   (Laughter)   Here\\'s my advice to my brown friends.   (Laughter)   The next time you\\'re on an airplane in the US, just speak your mother tongue. That way no one knows what you\\'re saying. Life goes on.   (Laughter)',\n",
       "  '   Granted, some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average American. If you\\'re walking down the aisle speaking Arabic, you might freak them out —   (Imitating Arabic)   They might say, \"What\\'s he talking about?\" The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters, is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you\\'re walking down the aisle.

       " [\" What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy?

And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous.   (Laughter)   And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them, those pictures are almost impossible to get.

For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out.   Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations o\",\n",
       "  \"f researchers, this study has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study.   Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II, and then most went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.   When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes and we interviewed thei\",\n",

They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that journey in the opposite direction.   The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues. Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives.   Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, \"Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn\\'t that interesting.\" The Harvard men never ask that question.   (Laughter)   To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don\\'t just send them questionnai',\n",

What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we\\'ve generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren\\'t about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.   We\\'ve learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to f',\n",

And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.   And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affe\",\n",

And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.

It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.

Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials in that recent survey, many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people \",\n",
       "  'who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community.   So what about you? Let\\'s say you\\'re 25, or you\\'re 40, or you\\'re 60. What might leaning in to relationships even look like?   Well, the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member who you haven\\'t spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges.   I\\'d like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: \"There isn\\'t time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.\"   The good life is built with good relationships.   Thank you.   (Applaus'],\n",
       " [\" When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed. I was two years older than my sister at the time — I mean, I'm two years older than her now — but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do, and I wanted to play war. So we were up on top of our bunk beds. And on one side of the bunk bed, I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry. And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge.   There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon, but since my sister is not here with us today, let me tell you the true story —   (Laughter)   which is my sister's a little on the clumsy side. Somehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all, Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor. I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground.   I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible. And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before —   (Laughter)   (Laughter ends)   heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,   (Laughter) for which I have yet \",\n",
       "  'to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could — she didn\\'t even see it coming — I was trying hard to be on my best behavior.   And I saw my sister\\'s face, this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winter\\'s nap for which they had settled. So I did the only thing my frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy. And if you have children, you\\'ve seen this hundreds of times. I said, \"Amy, wait. Don\\'t cry. Did you see how you landed? No human lands on all fours like that. Amy, I think this means you\\'re a unicorn.\"   (Laughter)   Now, that was cheating, because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister, but Amy the special unicorn. Of course, this option was open to her brain at no point in the past. And you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict, as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced, or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn. And the latter won. Instead of crying or ceasing our play, instead of waking my parents, with all the negative consequences for me, a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn —   (Laughter)   with one broken leg.   What we stumbled across at this tende',\n",
       "  \"r age of just five and seven — we had no idea at the time — was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain. We had stumbled across something called positive psychology, which is the reason I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning.   When I started talking about this research outside of academia, with companies and schools, the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph. The first thing I want to do is start with a graph. This graph looks boring, but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning. And this graph doesn't even mean anything; it's fake data. What we found is —   (Laughter)   If I got this data studying you, I would be thrilled, because there's a trend there, and that means that I can get published, which is all that really matters. There is one weird red dot above the curve, there's one weirdo in the room — I know who you are, I saw you earlier — that's no problem. That's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot. I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error. And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data.   (Laughter)   So one of the first things we teach people in economics, statistics, business and psychology courses is how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdo\",\n",
       "  's. How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit? Which is fantastic if I\\'m trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking — two.   But if I\\'m interested in your potential, or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity, we\\'re creating the cult of the average with science. If I asked a question like, \"How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?\" scientists change the answer to \"How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?\" and we tailor the class towards the average. If you fall below the average, then psychologists get thrilled, because that means you\\'re depressed or have a disorder, or hopefully both. We\\'re hoping for both because our business model is, if you come into a therapy session with one problem, we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten, so you keep coming back. We\\'ll go back into your childhood if necessary, but eventually we want to make you normal again. But normal is merely average.   And positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Then instead of deleting those positive outliers, what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say, why? Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual, athletic, musical ability, creativity, energy levels, resiliency in the face of challenge, sense of ',\n",
       "  'humor? Whatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you. Because maybe we can glean information, not just how to move people up to the average, but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide.   The reason this graph is important to me is, on the news, the majority of the information is not positive. in fact it\\'s negative. Most of it\\'s about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters. And very quickly, my brain starts to think that\\'s the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world. This creates \"the medical school syndrome.\" During the first year of medical training, as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases, suddenly you realize you have all of them.   (Laughter)   I have a brother in-law named Bobo, which is a whole other story. Bobo married Amy the unicorn. Bobo called me on the phone —   (Laughter)   from Yale Medical School, and Bobo said, \"Shawn, I have leprosy.\"   (Laughter)   Which, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare. But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.   (Laughter)   We\\'re finding it\\'s not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality. And if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at',\n",
       "  ' the same time.   I applied to Harvard on a dare. I didn\\'t expect to get in, and my family had no money for college. When I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they let me go. Something that wasn\\'t even a possibility became a reality. I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well, that they\\'d be excited to be there. Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you, I felt you\\'d be happy just to be in that classroom. But what I found is, while some people experience that, when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students — Harvard asked me to; I wasn\\'t that guy.   (Laughter)   I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years. And in my research and my teaching, I found that these students, no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or physics, but on the competition, the workload, the hassles, stresses, complaints.   When I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall, which is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up — I know some of you know this. When they\\'d visit, they\\'d look around, and say, \"This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart\\'s.\" It does, because that was Hogwart\\'s and that\\'s Harvard.',\n",
       "  ' And when they see this, they say, \"Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard? What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?\"   Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness. Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels, when in reality, if I know everything about your external world, I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness. 90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world. And if we change it, if we change our formula for happiness and success, we can change the way that we can then affect reality. What we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ, 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.   I talked to a New England boarding school, probably the most prestigious one, and they said, \"We already know that. So every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week. And we\\'re so excited. Monday night we have the world\\'s leading expert will speak about adolescent depression. Tuesday night it\\'s school violence and bullying. Wednesday night is eating disorders. Thursday night is illicit drug use. And Friday night we\\'re trying to decide be',\n",
       "  'tween risky sex or happiness.\"   (Laughter)   I said, \"That\\'s most people\\'s Friday nights.\"   (Laughter)   (Applause)   Which I\\'m glad you liked, but they did not like that at all. Silence on the phone. And into the silence, I said, \"I\\'d be happy to speak at your school, but that\\'s not a wellness week, that\\'s a sickness week. You\\'ve outlined all the negative things that can happen, but not talked about the positive.\"   The absence of disease is not health. Here\\'s how we get to health: We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success. In the last three years, I\\'ve traveled to 45 countries, working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn. And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: If I work harder, I\\'ll be more successful. And if I\\'m more successful, then I\\'ll be happier. That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior.   And the problem is it\\'s scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. Every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better one, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we\\'re going to change it. And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, y',\n",
       "  \"our brain never gets there. We've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon, as a society. And that's because we think we have to be successful, then we'll be happier.   But our brains work in the opposite order. If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise. In fact, we've found that every single business outcome improves. Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed. You're 37% better at sales. Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.   Which means we can reverse the formula. If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present, then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently. We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of. Because dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive, has two functions. Not only does it make you happier, it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way.   We've found t\",\n",
       "  \"here are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive. In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row, we can actually rewire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully. We've done these things in research now in every company that I've worked with, getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row, three new things each day. And at the end of that, their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first.   Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it. Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters. We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand. And finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness. We get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network.   And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies, what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success, and in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity, but a real revolution.   Thank you very much.   (Ap\"],\n",
       " [\" How do you explain when things don't go as we assume? Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions? For example: Why is Apple so innovative? Year after year, after year, they're more innovative than all their competition. And yet, they're just a computer company. They're just like everyone else. They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different? Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement? He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day. Why him? And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded — and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it. There's something else at play here.   About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it. As it turns out, there's a pattern. As it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world, whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers, they all think, act and communicate the exact same way. And it's the complete opposite to everyone else. All I did was codify it, and it's probably the world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle.   Why? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some \",\n",
       "  'leaders are able to inspire where others aren\\'t. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent. Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by \"why\" I don\\'t mean \"to make a profit.\" That\\'s a result. It\\'s always a result. By \"why,\" I mean: What\\'s your purpose? What\\'s your cause? What\\'s your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care? As a result, the way we think, we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in, it\\'s obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations — regardless of their size, regardless of their industry — all think, act and communicate from the inside out.   Let me give you an example. I use Apple because they\\'re easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: \"We make great computers. They\\'re beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one?\" \"Meh.\" That\\'s how most of us communicate. That\\'s how most marketing and sales are done, that\\'s how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do, we say how we\\'re different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that. Here\\'s our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients. Here\\'s our new car: It gets great gas mile',\n",
       "  'age, it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it\\'s uninspiring.   Here\\'s how Apple actually communicates. \"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?\" Totally different, right? You\\'re ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don\\'t buy what you do; people buy why you do it.   This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we\\'re also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple. As I said before, Apple\\'s just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors. Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact, they tried. A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs. They\\'re eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs. They\\'ve been making flat-screen monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products — and nobody bought one. In fact, talking about it now, we can\\'t even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company? But we do it every day. People don\\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what yo',\n",
       "  'u believe.   Here\\'s the best part: None of what I\\'m telling you is my opinion. It\\'s all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not psychology, biology. If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, from the top down, the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the \"what\" level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty. It\\'s also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.   In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn\\'t drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out, we\\'re talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, \"I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn\\'t feel right.\" Why would we use that verb, it doesn\\'t \"feel\" right? Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn\\'t control language. The best we can muster up is, \"I don\\'t know.  It just doesn\\'t feel right.\" Or sometimes you say you\\'re leading with your heart or soul. I hate to break it to you, those aren\\'t other body parts c',\n",
       "  'ontrolling your behavior. It\\'s all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.   But if you don\\'t know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it\\'s to hire people who believe what you believe. I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they\\'ll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they\\'ll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers.   Most people don\\'t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success. Even now, you ask people, \"Why did your product or why did your company fail?\" and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions. It\\'s always the same three things, so let\\'s explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day. He h',\n",
       "  'ired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley. Then how come we\\'ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?   A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success. They had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop. Not a single person on the Wright brothers\\' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur. And The New York Times followed them around nowhere.   The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief. They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it\\'ll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo and behold, look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright brothers\\' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that\\'s how many times they would crash before supper.   And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it. We found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: the day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit. He could have said, \"That\\'s an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology,\"',\n",
       "  ' but he didn\\'t. He wasn\\'t first, he didn\\'t get rich, he didn\\'t get famous, so he quit.   People don\\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. If you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe.   But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe? Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, if you don\\'t know the law, you know the terminology. The first 2.5% of our population are our innovators. The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters. The next 34% are your early majority, your late majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones is because you can\\'t buy rotary phones anymore.   (Laughter)   We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips. I love asking businesses, \"What\\'s your conversion on new business?\" They love to tell you, \"It\\'s about 10 percent,\" proudly. Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers. We all have about 10% who just \"get it.\" That\\'s how we describe them, right? That\\'s like that gut feeling, \"Oh, they just get it.\"   The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don\\'t get it? So it\\'s this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, \"Crossing the Chasm\" — because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. And these guys, the innovators ',\n",
       "  \"and the early adopters, they're comfortable making those gut decisions. They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week. These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat-screen TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard. And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves. It's because they wanted to be first. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe. In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe. The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours, stood in line for six hours, was because of what they believed about the world, and how they wanted everybody to see them: they were first. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.   So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation. First, the famous failure. It's a commercial example. As we said before, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions. You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute. They were extremely well-funded. Market conditions were fantastic. I mean, we use TiVo as verb. I TiVo stuff on my p\",\n",
       "  'iece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.   (Laughter)   But TiVo\\'s a commercial failure. They\\'ve never made money. And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it\\'s never traded above 10. In fact, I don\\'t think it\\'s even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes.   Because you see, when TiVo launched their product, they told us all what they had. They said, \"We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking.\" And the cynical majority said, \"We don\\'t believe you. We don\\'t need it. We don\\'t like it. You\\'re scaring us.\"   What if they had said, \"If you\\'re the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy, do we have a product for you. It pauses live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc.\" People don\\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.   Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation. In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date. How do you do that? Well, Dr. King wasn\\'t the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn\\'t the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America. In fact, some of his ideas were bad. But he had a gift. He didn\\'t go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed. \"I believe, I believe, I believe,\" he told people. And people who bel',\n",
